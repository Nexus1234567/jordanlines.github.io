        <h1> HTTP & Security Questions</h1>
		<h2>1. What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2>
		<p>HTTP is one of the most important protocols for data communiation and is responsible for the transfer of data over the web.</p>
		<h2>2. Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?</h2>
		<p>HTTP is a stateless protocol because once the session is ended (once you close the webpage) the transaction ends and the communication stops.</p>
		<h2>3. Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP</h2>
		<p>The 3 phases of a client-server protocol are "OK" also known as 200 which means the connection has established,
		   "Moved Permanently" also known as 301 which means that the URL resource has been changed and 
			finally "Not Found" also known as 404 which means the server can't find the resource.</p>
		<h2>4. Describe the parameters on a get and post request.</h2>
		<p>The "GET" method is used to request data from whatever you're trying to access and will be sent first,
		   followed by the "POST" method which will send the data to a server to create or update the resource.</p>
		<h2>5. What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</h2>
		<p>The best way to describe the response status codes are a set of predefined reponses that will appear when a condition is met
			as talked about previously the 200 status code means the connection has been established and 404 means the server can't find the resource.</p>
		<h2>6. What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</h2>
		<p></p>
		<h2>7. Why are cookies a security issue?</h2>
		<p>The nature of cookies is to store some information about the user visiting the webpage and while they can't be used to spread viruses
			so your computer is safe in that sense but the main security issue is to do with your privacy as they do store information about your habits online
			which not everyone is happy sharing.</p>
		<h2>8. Describe session hijacking and XSS</h2>
		<p>Hijacking is the act of intercepting a device trying to access a website through some form of exploit and once this has been done the 
		actual device is taken out of the equation and the hijacker acts as if it was that device so the website will send private information to them.
		XSS is the process of injecting scripts into a webpage used by a device which will then rather direct the device to a malicious server or allow them to control the device.</p>
		<h2>9. Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)</h2>
		<p>CSRF is an attack that tricks a browser into performing unwanted actions and kind of hijacks a legitimate website into doing it's dirty work.</p>
		<h2>10. What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?</h2>
		<p>CORS is a protocol that allows scripts running on a browser to interact with resources from a different origin and an example of a request that uses it is "fetch".</p>
